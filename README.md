# Data-Analysis---on-CVE-vulnerabilities-data

1.	Download the 2019 CVE json file from the NVD website
https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2019.json.zip

2.	Parse the contents of the json file to product a dataframe where each row represents a unique CVE identifier containing the following fields:
•	cve_id
•	description
•	cwe
•	publishedDate
•	lastModifiedDate
•	cvssV2_baseScore
•	number_of_references (total number of “references” for a given CVE)
•	exploitdb_flag (1 = at least one reference to www.exploit-db.com, 0 otherwise)

Question: Generate insights from the data ?

Solution:
1. Dataset formatting from json to dataframe (Selecting only required columns)
2. After formatting the data, there are total of 1480 records
3. After removing NULL values and Duplicate values the final dataframe has 13095 values
4. Basic data description was performed to understand the sttribute features 
5. Checked for correlation between the columns 
6. Checked for Outliers and plotted the distributions for the base Score column 
7. Grouped the data based on CWE codes and plotted over its frequency 
8. Explored the exploit-db flag column and plotted its frequency 
9. Plotted frequencies of exploit-db flag and CWE codes together (Identified a postive correlation) 
10. Picked up particular CWE code data and explored by plotting over time 
11. Finally analysed the text for CWE-79 code to understand the frequntly and keywords used
